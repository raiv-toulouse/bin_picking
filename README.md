# bin_picking
Bin Picking research project.
Bin Picking with Deep Learning, see [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydh_AdWZflA)

## Project Description
The objective of the project is to implement a Pick and Place task with a robotic arm using Artificial Intelligence techniques such as Image Recognition and Reinforcement Learning.  

The objects in the environment are distributed in a box randomly so the system will need to identify the objects and find an optimal set of movements for completing the task.  


## Architecture

![Architecture](ai_manager/readme-images/ROS_architecture.png)

ROS will be the tool used to interact and communicate with the robot. 

- **AI Manager** Package containing all the Artificial Intelligence code. 
- **Robot Controller** - Package for controlling, moving and interacting with the robot. 
- **Arduino** - Code used for detection, already load in the arduino. Included for future modifications and improvements
- **Raspberry** - Usb_cam package included
- **Universal Robot** - UR robot used in the proyect

You can find a more detailed explanation inside each folder.

Disclaimer: This project works with Ubuntu 18.08 and ROS Melodic. It's probable that for some parts of the project, different versions of python might be needed. 
It is **very recommended** to work with conda environments. 


## Requirements

1. Follow [ROS Tutorials](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials) to have a better understanding of how ROS works
2. Follow [Universal Robot Tutorial](https://academy.universal-robots.com/es/formacion-online/formacion-online-de-cb3/)
   
`conda install -c conda-forge empy`

`conda install pyserial`

`conda install -c conda-forge defusedxml`

`conda install -c conda-forge imutils`

3. Create your catkin_workspace (http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials/create_a_workspace) 
4. Install the following:

   `cd catkin_ws/src`
   
   `git clone https://github.com/UniversalRobots/Universal_Robots_ROS_Driver`

   `cd ..`
   
   `git clone -b calibration_devel https://github.com/fmauch/universal_robot.git src/fmauch_universal_robot`
   
   Edit the `fmauch_universal_robot/ur3_moveit_config/config/controllers.yaml` file and write this line (to correct this problem : https://github.com/ros-industrial/ur_modern_driver/issues/261#issuecomment-462254653): 
   
   `action_ns: scaled_pos_joint_traj_controller/follow_joint_trajectory`

   `sudo apt update -qq`
   
   `rosdep update`
   
   `rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -y`

   `git clone https://github.com/ros-controls/ros_controllers.git  src/ros_controllers`

   `sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-four-wheel-steering-controller` for Melodic, `sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-four-wheel-steering-controller` for Noetic

   `git clone https://github.com/raiv-toulouse/ur_icam.git src/ur_icam`

   `sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-moveit-commander`

   `sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-image-view`

   `sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-camera-info-manager`

   
   `rm -R src/ros_controllers/four_wheel_steering_controller` (to correct an error : -- Could NOT find urdf_geometry_parser (missing: urdf_geometry_parser_DIR))

   `catkin_make`
   
   `conda activate python2`
   
   To correct a bug (Failed to import pyassimp, see https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues/86 for more info)
   
   `~/anaconda3/envs/python2/bin/pip install  pyassimp`

5. Robot calibration. The first time you use this driver, you must extract the calibration from the robot to a file. (IP of the robot)
   - `roslaunch ur_calibration calibration_correction.launch robot_ip:=10.31.56.102 target_filename:="${HOME}/Calibration/ur3_calibration.yaml"`

6. Arduino:
- Install Arduino then configure to have access 

`sudo usermod -a -G tty <user>`

`sudo usermod -a -G dialout <user>` 

see http://doc.ubuntu-fr.org/arduino

and import ROS serial library to connect to the Arduino

For Melodic and Python2:

`sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-rosserial-arduino`

`sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-rosserial`

`cd ~/snap/arduino/current/Arduino/libraries`

`conda activate python2`

`rosrun rosserial_arduino make_libraries.py .`

For Noetic and Python3:

`sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-rosserial-arduino`

`sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-rosserial`

To correct this error : 

`Arduino/libraries/ros_lib/ros/msg.h:40:10: fatal error: cstring: No such file or directory  #include <cstring>`

`cd ~/snap/arduino/current/Arduino/libraries`

`rm -R ros_lib`

do what described here :

https://answers.ros.org/question/361930/rosserial-arduino-compilation-error-no-cstring/?answer=362407#post-id-362407

Use the  0.7.9 version, not the last one (0.9.4)

Another correction for Noetic (ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'SerialClient') :

`sudo gedit /opt/ros/noetic/lib/python3/dist-packages/rosserial_arduino/__init__.py`

then add a . (point) before SerialClient

`from .SerialClient import *` 

- Install the [usb_camera package](https://github.com/ros-drivers/usb_cam)
- Find the arduino port (probably this step is not necessary)

7. Don't forget to configure ROS_MASTER and ROS_IP in every computer and in the Raspberry to connect all the nodes in the architecture
   -`export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://10.31.56.80:11311/` (IP Of the ROS_MASTER)
   -`export ROS_IP=10.31.56.75` (IP of nodes)


## Environment Setup 
Note: Please enter the each of the following commands in a new terminal

1. Switch on the robot

3. Initialize ROS, Moveit and Universal Robot. Must be run in the same computer

- `roslaunch ur_robot_driver ur3_bringup.launch robot_ip:=10.31.56.102 kinematics_config:=${HOME}/Calibration/ur3_calibration.yaml`

On the robot, a program with this instruction has been saved under the name of 'communication_with_ros.urp')
By clicking on the Command tab after having selected the ExternalControl command, make sure that the Host IP is correct (IP of the computer on which the previous roslaunch command was launched).
If this is not the case, click on the Installation tab then External Control to correct this. 

Finally, **you have to press the small Play button at the bottom of the graphical interface**. 
If you now return to the `roslaunch` terminal, the following lines should have appeared: 
 *Robot requested program*  
 *Sent program to robot*  
 *Robot ready to receive control commands*  

- `roslaunch ur3_moveit_config ur3_moveit_planning_execution.launch`

2. Initialize the Robot Controller. Same computer as before but with a python2 environment.
- `conda activate python2`
- `rosrun robot_controller main_controller.py` 

3. Initialize the information from arduino.
- `conda activate python2`  (for Melodic) ,  `conda activate python3`  (for Noetic)
- `rosrun rosserial_arduino serial_node.py _port:=/dev/ttyACM0`

4. Initialize the 2 cameras

If you plug the 2 cameras on the same computer, plug them on different USB port (e.g 1 camera on the USB2 port, the other on the USB3 port) 
- `roslaunch usb_cam usb_2_cameras.launch`

You should see the images of the two cameras.

5. Run AI Manager (Use it in the DL Server)
- `ssh bin_picking@10.31.56.62` (log on DL machine with bin_picking account)
- `conda activate python3`
- `rosrun ai_manager main.py`
